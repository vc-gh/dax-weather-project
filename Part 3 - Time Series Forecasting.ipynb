These will serve as a baseline against which we can compare more sophisticated models.\n\nUsing values at recent timesteps (such as the most recent timestep `t-1` and second-most recent timestep `t-2`) to predict the current value at time `t` is what's known as persistence modeling, or using the last observed value to predict the next following value. These preceding timesteps are often referred to in time-series analysis as `lags`. So, the value at time `t-1` is known as the `1st lag` and the value at time `t-2` is the `2nd lag`.\n\nWe can also create baselines based on rolling (or moving) averages. This is a time-series constructed by averaging each lagged value up to the selected lag. For example, a 6-period (or 6-lag) rolling avearge is the average of the previous 6 hourly lags `t-6` to `t-1`.\n\nOur baseline models will be:\n1. `1st lag` - i.e. values at `t-1`\n2. `2nd lag` - i.e. values at `t-2`\n3. `6-lag` rolling average\n4. `12-lag` rolling average"

In regression problems involving prediction of a numerical value, we often use a measure of the difference between our predicted value and the actual value. This is referred to as an error measure or error metric. A common measure is the Mean Squared Error (MSE):\n\n\\begin{equation}\nMSE = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i=1}^{n}{(y_i - \\hat y_i)^{2}}\n\\end{equation}\n\nThis is the average of the squared differences between predicted values $ \\hat y $ and actual values $ y $.\n\nBecause the MSE is in \"units squared\" it can be difficult to interpet, hence the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) is often used:\n\n\\begin{equation}\nRMSE = \\sqrt {MSE} \n\\end{equation}\n\nThis is the square root of the MSE, and is in the same units as the values $ y $. We can compare the RMSE (and MSE) values for different models and say that the model that has the lower MSE is better at predicting temperatures, all things equal. Note that MSE and RMSE will grow large quickly if the differences between predicted and actual values are large. This may or may not be a desired quality of your error measure. In this case, it is probably a good thing, since a model that makes large mistakes in temperature prediction will be much less useful than one which makes small mistakes.\n\nNext, we calculate the RMSE measure for each of our baseline models, on the full validation set."

            "source": "The RMSE results confirm what we saw in the graph above. It is clear that the _rolling average_ baselines perform poorly. In fact, the `t-2` lagged baseline is also not very good. It appears that the best baseline model is to simply use the current hour's temperature to predict the next hour's temperature!\n\nCan we do better than this simple baseline using more sophisticated models?\n\n<a id=\"cell3\"></a>\n\n### 2. Train Statistical Time-series Analysis Models\n\n\nIn the previous section, we saw that a simple `lag-1` baseline model performed reasonably well at forecasting temperature for the next hourly time step. This is perhaps not too surprising, given what we know about hourly temperatures. Generally, the temperature in a given hour will be quite closely related to the temperature in the previous hour. This phenomenon is very common in time-series analysis and is known as [autocorrelation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autocorrelation) - that is, the time series is `correlated` with previous values of itself. More precisely, the values at time `t` are correlated with lagged values (which could be `t-1`, `t-2` and so on).\n\nAnother thing we saw previously is the concept of _moving averages_. In this case the moving-average baseline was not that good at prediction. However it is common in many time-series for a moving average to capture some of the underlying structure and be useful for prediction.\n\nIn order to make our model better at predicting temperature, ideally we would want to take these aspects into account. Fortunately, the statistical community has a long history of analyzing time series and has created many different forecasting models.\n\nHere, we will explore one called SARIMAX - the **S**easonal **A**uto**R**egressive **I**ntegrated **M**oving **A**verage with e**X**ogenous regressors model. \n\nThis sounds like a very complex name, but if we look at the components of the name, we see that it includes `autocorrelation` (this is what auto regressive means) and `moving averages`, which are the components mentioned above. \n\nThe SARIMAX model also allows including a _seasonal_ model component as well as handling *exogenous* variables, which are external to the time-series value itself. For example, for temperature prediction we may wish to take into account not just previous temperature values, but perhaps other weather features which may have an effect on temperature (such as humidity, rainfall, wind, and so on).\n\nFor the purposes of this notebook, we will not explore modeling of seasonal components or exogenous variables.\n\nIf we drop the \"S\" and \"X\" from the model, we are left with an [ARIMA model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoregressive_integrated_moving_average) (Auto-regressive Integrated Moving Average). This is a very commonly used model for time-series analysis and we will use it in this notebook by only specifying the relevant model components of the full SARIMAX model.\n\n#### 2.1 Replicating a baseline model\n\nAs a starting point, we will see how we can use SARIMAX to create a simple model that in fact replicates one of the baselines we created previously. Auto-regression, as we have seen, means using values from preceding time periods to predict the current value. Recall that one of our baseline models was the `1st lag` or `t-1` model. In time-series analysis this is referred to as an **AR(1)** model, meaning an **A**uto-**R**egressive model for `lag 1`.\n\nTechnically, the AR(1) model is not exactly the same as our baseline model. A statistical time series model like SARIMAX learns a set of `weights` to apply to each component of the model. These weights are set so as to best fit the dataset. We can think of our baseline as setting the `weight` for the `t-1` lag to be exactly `1`. In practice, our time-series model will not have a weight of exactly `1` (though it will likely be very close to that), hence the predictions will be slightly different.\n\nNow, lets fit our model to the dataset. First, we will set up the model inputs by taking the temperature column of our dataframe. We do this for training and validation sets."

We will not cover the `d` parameter here. Taken together this specifies the parameters of the [ARIMA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoregressive_integrated_moving_average) model portion of SARIMAX.\n\nTo create an AR(1) model, we set the `order` to be `(1, 0, 0)`.

We saw that it performed a lot worse than the `t-1` baseline. Intuitively, this makes sense, since we are throwing away a lot of information about the most recent lag `t-1`. However, the `t-2` lag still provides some useful information. In fact, for temperature prediction it's likely that the last few hours can provide some value.\n\nFortunately, our ARIMA model framework provides an easy way to incorporate further lag information. We can construct a model that includes _both_ the `t-1` and `t-2` lags. This is an **AR(2)** model (meaning an auto-regressive model up to lag `2`). We can specify this with the model order parameter `p=2`."

The ARIMA framework makes this easy to do, by setting the order parameter `q`. A value of `q=1` specifies a **MA(1)** model (including the first lag `t-1`), while `q=6` would include all the lags from `t-1` to `t-6`.\n\nNote that the moving average model component is a little different from the simple moving or rolling averages computed in the baseline models. The [definition of the MA model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moving-average_model) is rather technical, but conceptually you can think of it as using a form of weighted moving average (compared to our baseline which would be a simple, unweighted average).\n\nLet's add an MA(1) component to our AR(2) model."
